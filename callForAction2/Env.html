		<ol>
			<li>First, polar bears are stressed by <strong><span class="hl">GLOBAL WARMING</span></strong>. Their habitats have been decreased dramatically, which leads to the depopulation of polar bears. Take a survey on Northeast and Northwest Alaska as an example, the study shows that from 2001 to 2010, the population in that region has decreased 40% (worldwildlife.org).  </li>

			<br>
			<li>Third, as high-leveled predators, polar bears often ingest <strong><span class="hl">TOXIC CHEMICAL</span></strong> from various food resources because of human outputing industrial or other wastes. The toxic substance might also reach and poison cubs of polar bears, causing low survival rates.</li>
			
			<br>
			<li>Third, global <strong><span class="hl">OIL EXPLIRATION</span></strong> activities greatly increased the chance of oil spills, which not only poison individuals, but also devastate the habitats of polar bears.</li>
