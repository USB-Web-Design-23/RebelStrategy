		<h2>Baroque Period (1580-1750)</h2>
		<p>The Baroque period brought about some more common stardards for classical music.  For instance the size of orchesetras grew and this led to new ways of expressing this style.  In Italy opera was created and along with that forms such as sonatas and concertos started to be used.  This meant that the genre was moving towards more complexity instead of simpler songs.  Some composers of this era were Johan Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi and George Frideric Handel.</p>
