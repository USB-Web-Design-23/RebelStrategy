		<!-- This is the text for "Reocurring Dream (rd)"-->
		<div class="emb_text" id="rd">
			<p class="general_text">"Victorian Rhapsody" was a reoccuring dream that I had in September of 2022. This is <strong>first</strong> html file that I have ever written in my life. In this webpage, I shared a dream that I went to <strong>Victoria, Australia</strong> in 2021 to see a friend of mine. She showed me around the neighborhood and the downtown, telling me what's going on with her in last two years. I can still remember we used to write letters to each other in the middle school, and interestingly this person jumps upon my dream one night... Maybe I should visit there in my real life.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- This is the text for "About Me (am)" -->
		<div class="emb_text" id="am" style="display: none;">
			<p class="general_text"> About Me! In this project I introduced myself in three sections: my academic passion, my athletic interests and the music that I like. I learned how to insert <strong>images and videos</strong> in this project, as well as using <strong>the list element</strong>.</p>
		</div>	

		<!-- This is the text for "Favorite Animal (fa)" -->
		<div class="emb_text" id="fa" style="display: none;">
			<p class="general_text"> My favorite animals are <strong>tarantulas</strong>, which, I used to pet. Once I wanted to have a pet dog or cat in my house, mom refused to that. Instead, I start to pet tarantulas that are easier to feed and nest. They are really cool animals! This webpage shares the information that I learn from petting tarantulas. I learned how to write a <strong>CSS file</strong>, the "Cascading Style Sheet" for setting up some universal styles in my webpage.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- This is the text for "Call for Environmental Action (cfa)" -->
		<div class="emb_text" id="cfa" style="display: none;">
			<p class="general_text"> In this project, I did some researches on some of the vital problems that polar bears are facing. The primary motivation is that I have heard the glacier size, which is the homeland of polar bears, has been drastically decreasing due to global warming. Therefore, I looked up more detailed information on this topic then called for the an environmental action for polar bears in this webpage. I also learned how to use <strong>a-label</strong>, which are <strong>links to online webpages or other local files</strong>, enabling me to share a little more online source to my readers.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- This is the text for "Collector's Guide (cg)" -->
		<div class="emb_text" id="cg" style="display: none;">
			<p class="general_text"> In the Collector's Guide, I partnered with Asa and we did a collection of music in different genres. We finished all our html works first, then we created a CSS file together. This can be an efficient teamwork strategy that I think is worthy pointing out. This time, I learned to <strong>use a-labels to link different local html files</strong>.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- This is the text for "Pacific Northwest (pnw)" -->
		<div class="emb_text" id="pnw" style="display: none;">
			<p class="general_text">The Pacific Northwest, also known as Astoria, is where I live and go for high schools. The weather here is cool all the time in a year, therefore there're a variety of activities created due to the whether, such as skiing. In the project I introduced a few places worthy visiting and some activities worthy trying. I learned more about where I live. On the perspective of, WEB design, I learn how to define <strong>keyframes</strong> and thus generate <strong>animation</strong> in my webpages.</p>
		</div>	

		<!-- This is the text for "Buzzfeed Quiz (bq)" -->
		<div class="emb_text" id="bq" style="display: none;">
			<p class="general_text">Buzzfeed Quiz is the last project I have in this year, I this project I learned how to write <strong>javascript</strong> in a html file. I partnered with Jerry this time, and we strategically distributed our works, and therefore we could fluently complete this project. The theme <strong>anime</strong> is something shared between I and Jerry, and we were both passionate when we were doing this project.</p>
